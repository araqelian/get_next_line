# get_next_line

Mandatory part

• Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.

• Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.

• Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when
reading from the standard input.

• Please note that the returned line should include the terminating \n character,
except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.

• Your header file get_next_line.h must at least contain the prototype of the
get_next_line() function.

• Add all the helper functions you need in the get_next_line_utils.c file.

• Because you will have to read files in get_next_line(), add this option to your
compiler call: -D BUFFER_SIZE=n
It will define the buffer size for read().
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette
in order to test your code.

• You will compile your code as follows (a buffer size of 42 is used as an example):
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c

 • We consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior if the file pointed to
by the file descriptor changed since the last call whereas read() didn’t reach the
end of file.

 • We also consider that get_next_line() has an undefined behavior when reading
a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if
you want to.
  
# Bonus part
  
This project is straightforward and doesn’t allow complex bonuses. However, we trust
your creativity. If you completed the mandatory part, give a try to this bonus part.
Here are the bonus part requirements:

• Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.

• Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
For example, if you can read from the file descriptors 3, 4 and 5, you should be
able to read from a different fd per call without losing the reading thread of each
file descriptor or returning a line from another fd.
It means that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then
fd 4, then 5, then once again 3, once again 4, and so forth.
Append the _bonus.[c\h] suffix to the bonus part files.
It means that, in addition to the mandatory part files, you will turn in the 3 following
files:
  
• get_next_line_bonus.c
• get_next_line_bonus.h
• get_next_line_utils_bonus.c
